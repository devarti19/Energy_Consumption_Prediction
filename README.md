# Energy_Consumption_Prediction

The usage of power directly affects the expenses associated with energy management, the distribution of energy, and the environment. When it comes to accurately and scalably forecasting power demand, established solutions have inherent limitations. Thanks to advancements in machine learning methods, it is now possible to predict power consumption accurately using historical data. For predicting electricity usage, I'm utilizing a machine learning-based approach. We explore several machine learning methods, such as linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, XGBOOST, random forest, and artificial neural networks (ANN), to anticipate power consumption. We developed and evaluated these models using historical electricity information obtained from a power utility company. The information provides hourly power usage data for a year that has been pre-processed to account for outliers and missing data. The effectiveness of the models was evaluated using a number of evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2).
